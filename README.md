# PHP Dev Environment Using Docker


## Overview

This is a starter project for a PHP development environment using Docker. A docker-compose file is used to set up the required docker containers and a Makefile is used to store the required docker commands to start up the containers.

## Prerequisites

- General knowledge on how to use docker and docker-compose
- General knowledge on PHP web development

## Run Code locally

To run the project locally, please follow the steps given below.

- Clone this Repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Wandonium/php-docker-starter
  ```

- Go to Project directory

  ```bash
  cd php-docker-starter
  ```

- Start up the docker containers using the commands in the Makefile

  ```bash
  make run
  ```

- Print out the logs for the MySQL container and look for the 'ready for connections' text to make sure MySQL server is up and running.

  ```bash
  docker logs php-docker-starter-mysql-1
  ```

### Expected Output
